# Cursor for PMs
# 🚀 Project: Strategic Discovery Agent (The "Cursor for PMs")
### *A direct response to Y Combinator's Spring 2026 RFS: "Helping teams figure out what to build, not just how to build it."*

---

## 💡 The Vision
In early 2026, YC issued a call for a **"Cursor for Product Managers."** They identified a critical gap: while AI coding agents (like Cursor and Claude Code) have revolutionized *execution*, the hardest part of product—**Discovery**—remains a manual, fragmented mess of Slack messages, Gong transcripts, and gut feelings.

This project is a functional prototype of an AI-native system designed to automate the product discovery loop. It doesn't just write PRDs; it **reasons** through customer pain points, market risks, and technical feasibility to determine **what should be built next.**

## 🛠️ The System Architecture (Agentic vs. Automatic)
Unlike static AI wrappers, this system uses an **Agentic Workflow** built with **LangGraph** and **Replit**, ensuring that the output is challenged and refined before it ever hits a PM's desk.

### The Agent Swarm:
1.  **The Archaeologist (Ingestion Agent):** Scours unstructured data (mock customer interviews, support tickets, and market news) to extract high-signal "pain points."
2.  **The Skeptic (Critique Agent):** Acts as the "Devil’s Advocate." It looks for reasons *not* to build a feature—citing technical debt, regulatory risks (Fintech focus), or low ROI.
3.  **The Synthesizer (Writer Agent):** Reconciles the conflict between the Researcher and the Skeptic to produce a high-confidence PRD and a "Traceability Graph" (linking every feature back to a specific user quote).

## 🏗️ Technical Stack
* **Orchestration:** [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) (for stateful, multi-agent loops).
* **Environment:** [Replit](https://replit.com/) (for rapid deployment and API management).
* **Intelligence:** GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via API).
* **Interface:** [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) (Voice-first interaction for "on-the-go" product briefing).

---

## 📈 Why This Matters for PMs
* **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Moves away from "I think" to "The data shows."
* **Reduced "Document Fatigue":** High-quality PRDs are the *byproduct* of the discovery process, not the goal.
* **Technical Agency:** This project demonstrates my ability to architect complex AI systems and speak the language of engineering teams.

## 🏁 How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the Replit Secrets.
3. Upload a sample customer interview `.txt` file to the `/data` folder.
4. Run `main.py` to start the discovery loop.
