# 🚀 Project: Strategic Discovery Agent (The "Cursor for PMs")
### *A direct response to Y Combinator's Spring 2026 RFS*

## 🔗 Live Prototype
**Try it yourself:** [Cursor for PMs Live Demo](https://cursor-for-pms-jjccll.replit.app)  

> 👋 **I'd love your thoughts!** I have enabled a feedback widget on the Replit site. If you test an idea, please let me know if the "Skeptic" was too harsh or if the "Lead PM" missed a key detail.

## 💡 The Vision
Building a product is about making high-stakes decisions under uncertainty. This project implements a **Multi-Agent State Machine** (via LangGraph) that simulates a professional product team's discovery loop. 

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
* **The Archaeologist:** Performs RAG-style analysis on market trends.
* **The Skeptic:** Specifically hunts for technical debt, legal risks, and ROI blockers.
* **The Synthesizer:** Reconciles the debate into a structured, actionable PRD.

## 📊 Case Study: First Run Output
**Feature Idea:** *A dedicated social network for pet owners.*

Below is the output from the system's first execution. It shows how the agents successfully identified that while the market is huge, the **veterinary compliance risks** make a "Big Bang" launch dangerous.

**Archaeologist (Researcher):** "Build it—pet ownership is at 70%, and content virality is proven. There is a clear gap for niche coordination (vets/meetups)."

**Skeptic (Critic):** "Wait—hosting 'vet advice' without VCPR compliance is a legal minefield. Precise location sharing for 'lost pets' creates stalking risks. Scaling video storage will blow up OPEX."

**Synthesizer (Lead PM) Recommendation:** **NO GO** for a full product. **GO** for a 3-month experimental pilot.

## 🛠️ Next Steps & Tinkering
I'm not done! My next steps for this prototype include:
1. **RAG Integration:** Connecting the agents to real CSV/JSON data folders.
2. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Adding a "Pause" node so the user can steer the agents mid-loop.
3. **Fintech Compliance:** Hard-coding a "Regulatory Knowledge Base" for the Skeptic.

### 👋 Connect
I’m building this to show that PMs can be as agent-native as the engineers they partner with. Let's talk!
