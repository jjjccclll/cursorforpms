# 🚀 Project: Strategic Discovery Agent (The "Cursor for PMs")
### *A direct response to Y Combinator's Spring 2026 RFS: "Helping teams figure out what to build, not just how to build it."*

## 🔗 Live Prototype
**Experience the Agent Swarm here:** [Cursor for PMs Live Demo](https://cursor-for-pms-jjccll.replit.app)  
> **Note:** I've enabled a feedback widget on the prototype. I'm actively tinkering with the orchestration—**I welcome any feedback on the agentic reasoning or the output quality!**

## 💡 The Vision
Building a product isn't just about writing code; it's about making high-stakes decisions under uncertainty. This project implements a **Multi-Agent State Machine** (using LangGraph) that simulates a professional product team's discovery loop. It forces a "clash of perspectives" between research and risk to produce evidence-based PRDs.

### 🏗️ Technical Architecture
* **The Archaeologist (Research):** Performs RAG-style analysis on market trends and customer pain points.
* **The Skeptic (Risk/Compliance):** Acts as the "Devil’s Advocate," specifically hunting for technical debt, legal risks, and ROI blockers.
* **The Synthesizer (Lead PM):** Reconciles the debate into a structured, actionable PRD.

## 📊 Case Study: First Run Output
**Feature Idea:** *A dedicated social network for pet owners.*

Below is the raw output from the system's first execution. Notice how the **Skeptic** identified high-stakes Fintech risks (malpractice, KYC fraud, and data privacy) that the **Archaeologist** initially missed.

### 🕵️ Archaeologist Report
**Recommendation:** Build it.  
**Key Signal:** 70% of US households own pets; high content virality on TikTok/Instagram. Specialized networks show higher retention than broad platforms.  
**Pain Points Solved:** Noise in mainstream feeds, fragmented local coordination (vets/meetups), and medical continuity (lost-pet alerts).

### ⚖️ Skeptic Report
**Counter-Argument:** Do not build as a standalone product today.  
**Risks:** * **Regulatory:** Hosting "vet advice" without VCPR compliance is a legal minefield. 
* **Security:** Precise location sharing for "lost pets" creates stalking/theft risks. 
* **Economics:** High video storage and moderation OPEX before monetization stabilizes.

### 📝 Synthesizer (Lead PM) Recommendation: "NO GO" (Phased Only)
**The Verdict:** While the market is massive, the legal and safety risks are too high for a "Big Bang" launch.  
**Strategic Pivot:** Proceed with a 3-month Phase A focused on "demand-signal pilots" (newsletters/micro-communities) and legal scoping before any heavy engineering investment.

## 🛠️ What's Next? (Tinkering Roadmap)
This is a living prototype. My next iterations will focus on:

1.  **Direct RAG Integration:** Connecting the **Archaeologist** to real-time vector databases (e.g., Pinecone) containing actual Intercom logs and support tickets.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Implementing a "Pause" state where the PM must approve the Researcher's findings before the Skeptic is allowed to critique.
3.  **Cost-Awareness Agent:** Adding a node that estimates API/Infrastructure costs for proposed features to calculate a "Pre-launch ROI."
4.  **Fintech Compliance Guardrails:** Hard-coding a "Regulatory Knowledge Base" so the Skeptic can cite specific SEC or GDPR articles.

### 👋 Feedback
I’m building this to show that PMs can be as technical and agent-native as the engineers they partner with. If you have thoughts on the logic or UX, let’s talk!
